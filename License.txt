Description

A library for objectively measuring image/video quality. 
It implements many popular algorithms, such as MS-SSIM, MS-SSIM*, SIMM, MSE, and PSNR. 
It is designed to be fast, accurate, and reliable. 


Delphi port 

This is a port (major rework) from C to Delphi by Gabriel Moraru.
It can be compiled directly and requires no additional libraries.
The code should be compilable also on Lazarus/FPC.
It also fixes two bugs.
I also translated some of the unit tests.
I HAVEN'T IMPLEMENTED _iqa_img_filter!
The original C code can he found in the IQA folder or can be downloaded from http://tdistler.com/iqa
