Description

A library for objectively measuring image/video quality.
It implements many popular algorithms, such as MS-SSIM, MS-SSIM*, SIMM, MSE, and PSNR.
It is designed to be fast, accurate, and reliable.


Delphi port

This is a port (major rework) from C to Delphi.
The original C code can be downloaded from http://tdistler.com/iqa
I also translated some unit tests, but I HAVEN'T IMPLEMENTED _iqa_img_filter.


Compilation 

It can be compiled directly and requires no additional libraries.
The code should be compilable also on Lazarus/FPC.
It also fixes two bugs found in the original C code.


Copyright/Conditions

The copyright conditions are quite relaxed. See Copyright.txt

Have fun.
Long live Pascal :)
